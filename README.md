# Herbarium 2020 Challenge Dataset Neural Network Try
Undergraduate thesis work to train an identification neural network for herbarium sheet images. Training and testing is done on the Herbarium 2020 Challenge Dataset by the New York Botanical Garden. Much work has been done in training state-of-the-art neural networks, such as EfficientNet and SE-ResNeXt-50, using PyTorch and pytorch-image-models. 

Ongoing work includes the pre-processing of data as well as improvements in model accuracy through parameter tweaking.
